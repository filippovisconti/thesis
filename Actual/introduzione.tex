\section{Termini di base}

Computer networks there are a variety of the following types of computer network based on scope. The scope here is how big the computer network will be built. Based on spaces in scope, a computer network can be distinguished into two, namely [1] : a) Local Area Network (LAN), is a computer network which is built in the room a small scope as a single building or group of buildings. LAN is built in a limited scope and usually owned by organizations that already have the devices installed. An internal data rate of the LAN is usually much greater than the WAN. Wide Area Network (WAN), is a network that covers a large geographic area requires delimiters and rely at least partly on the circuit provided by public operators. Typically, a WAN consists of a number of switching node interconnects. A transmission from one of the devices is channeled through the internal node to the device purpose. This node (including node limit) does not affect the contents of the data, their goal was to
provide a switching facility will move data from node to node until they reach their destination. Traditionally, WAN has been implemented using one of the two technologies: circuit switching and packet switching. Recently, frame relay and ATM networks have assumed the lead role which uses it [2].
2.2 Virtual Private Network
Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a computer network where connections between its nodes utilize public networks (internet/WAN) as it may be in certain cases or conditions do not allow it to build its own infrastructure. When the Connect VPN, the interconnection between the node such as an independent network that has actually created a special line pass through connection or a public network. At every company site, workstations, servers, and databases connected by one or more local area network (LAN) a LAN is under the control of the network manager and can be configured and tuned for cost-effective. The Internet or other public networks can be used to connect the sites, provide cost savings over the use of private networks and reduction of the burden of wide area network traffic to providers of public networks [2].
